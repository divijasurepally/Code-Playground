# BackTrack Code - Subset Sum Solver using Backtracking Algorithm
# Code explanation: this code is a basic example of using nested loops to find pairs of numbers in an array that add up to a specific target sum. It uses an ArrayList of lists to store the pairs it finds and then prints out those pairs. However, note that this approach has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the nested loops, which can be inefficient for large arrays.
